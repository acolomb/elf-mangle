	* Add support for GNU Gettext and Gnulib packages.  To use Gnulib,
	it must be installed on the packager's machine, who runs
	`gnulib-tool --update` in the top-level package directory.  The
	resulting distribution archive will include all necessary gnulib
	checks to work around problematic user platforms during
	compilation.

	* Release version 0.2.
