2023-08-01  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Fix exit code when writing to the output image file was
	successful.  The number of bytes written was returned and used as
	exit code, when it should be zero on success and non-zero only on
	error.
	* Fix building without the custom post-processor module.  An
	undefined reference regarding the demo --skip-checksum error would
	otherwise fail the build.

	* Release version 1.2

2023-07-03  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Extend the --print option to accept a "defines" format
	specification which causes the contents to be printed as key-value
	pairs with a hexadecimal byte dump.  These assignments are
	suitable for feeding back into the --define option, to port
	override definitions to another map file independently.
	* Add an option --defines-from to accept override specifications
	from a text file.  They can still be overridden from the command
	line.  Standard input can be read from by supplying a single dash
	as file name.  The key-value pairs can be delimited by newlines
	and / or commas in the file, and white-space between hex byte
	values is ignored.
	* Add an option --changed to skip unchanged fields while printing.
	Unchanged means they have the same value as specified in the
	output ELF map file, thus not affected by the input image file,
	the copy transformation or any overrides.  This implies some
	memory usage overhead, as the original value of all processed
	symbols needs to be cached (only when the option is in use).
	* Fall back to hex-dump when pretty-printing unknown fields.
	Fields without a designated print function never had their
	contents printed at all, only a description or symbol name.
	Unless there is a valid description string, assume it's an unknown
	field and dump the raw byte contents.  This should be more useful
	than skipping the value altogether.  The previous behavior can be
	restored with the --print=pretty-only option.
	* Rework elf-mangle's error reporting behavior and bail out if
	processing fails.  Previously only command line parsing errors
	were fatal, but many other errors during operation were silently
	skipped over.  These now exit the program with an appropriate
	non-zero exit code after consistently printing a message to the
	standard error stream.

	* Fix a bug where unknown fields were not transferred from the
	input to the output map.  This happened only in the presence of
	unknown symbol names, i.e. without a custom_known_fields
	implementation, because the list of unknown symbols was unsorted
	while the transformation expected a sorted list.
	* Fix an unlikely crash when printing a field without a known
	description string.
	* Reduce memory usage when finding fewer symbols than expected
	from the known field definitions.
	* Update submodule reference to forked libcintelhex snapshot, to
	incorporate a segfault fix while auto-detecing the format of an
	invalid ihex file (without colons and therefore no records at
	all).
	* Update German translation.

	* Release version 1.1

2022-07-08  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Add facility to implement custom post-processors on the output
	image data, with the ability to further modify contained fields.
	* Implement an example post-processor to calculate and store a CRC
	checksum over the binary data.

	* Release version 1.0

2021-11-15  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Update pointers to available libelf implementations.
	* Minor build system updates.

	* Release version 0.6.2

2019-10-21  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Fix cross-compilation error related to undefined rpl_malloc and
	rpl_realloc symbols.

	* Release version 0.6.1

2016-11-02  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Fix offset output showing wrong numbers when using the
	length-prefixed string search function (--strings option).
	* Refactor internal handling of binary blobs to allow loading an
	image file into memory for later processing.
	* Add the lpstrings utility, similar to the standard POSIX
	strings(1) command.
	* Fix a corner case in build system configuration which would
	overwrite user-supplied CPPFLAGS / LDFLAGS variables.
	* Update German translation.

	* Release version 0.6

2016-09-19  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Minor clean-ups for the build system and detection of libelf
	library.
	* Update the documentation with used build utility versions.

	* Release version 0.5.1

2015-09-14  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Fix possible memory access error caused by a missing check for
	the source field size in field copy functions.  This changes the
	signature of the field_copy_f function prototype and all its
	implementations.  Therefore bump the minor version.

	* Release version 0.5

2015-08-14  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Fix segmentation fault when using Intel Hex files, caused by an
	error in libcintelhex.  A newer pre-release of libcintelhex is now
	referenced for the submodule.

	* Release version 0.4.2

2015-07-22  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Fix README.md syntax compatibility for GitHub and include it in
	the distribution.
	* Fix bugs related to the handling of text / binary file modes on
	Windows.
	* Update included libcintelhex reference to benefit from bug fixes
	there, some also related to binary file handling on Windows.
	* Fix some localization issues (non-translatable strings, missing
	newline).
	* Add a TODO list with ideas for future development.
	* Install documentation files: README, TODO, LICENSE, ChangeLog
	* Update German translation.

	* Release version 0.4.1

2015-04-09  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Rework the build system, fixing several usage and portability
	problems.  Integrate GNU libtool for building libraries.
	* Fix a problem with iterating through symbol lists caused by an
	uninitialized local variable.
	* Rename the option --byte-size to --field-size and add another
	option --section-size.
	* Fix offset output for the --strings option to point at the
	length prefix byte.
	* Abuse the --symbols option to generate more machine-readable
	(non-localized) output for --strings and --section-size.
	* Adjust help output to exclude unavailable options and reflect
	the actually used default values.
	* Fix error handling when an expected ELF section could not be
	found.
	* Handle unprintable characters in custom_known_fields.c example.
	* Validate argument in custom_options.c example for --set-serial.
	* Revised README document for new features and minor corrections.

	* Release version 0.4.

2014-08-08  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Clean up build system for more stability and better user
	interaction.
	* Fix some portability problems to enable building on MinGW.
	* Switch default output image format to Intel Hex, as the help
	string already stated.
	* Fix help output to list --strings option in the right group.
	* Include German translation.
	* Include a README document with detailed setup and usage
	instructions.

	* Release version 0.3.

2014-06-06  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Add support for GNU Gettext and Gnulib packages.  To use Gnulib,
	it must be installed on the packager's machine, who runs
	`gnulib-tool --update` in the top-level package directory.  The
	resulting distribution archive will include all necessary gnulib
	checks to work around problematic user platforms during
	compilation.

	* Release version 0.2.

2014-05-28  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Release version 0.1.
