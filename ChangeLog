	length-prefixed string search function (--strings option).
	* Refactor internal handling of binary blobs to allow loading an
	image file into memory for later processing.
	* Add the lpstrings utility, similar to the standard POSIX
	strings(1) command.
	* Fix a corner case in build system configuration which would
	overwrite user-supplied CPPFLAGS / LDFLAGS variables.
	* Update German translation.

	* Release version 0.6

2016-09-19  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Minor clean-ups for the build system and detection of libelf
	library.
	* Update the documentation with used build utility versions.

	* Release version 0.5.1

2015-09-14  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Fix possible memory access error caused by a missing check for
	the source field size in field copy functions.  This changes the
	signature of the field_copy_f function prototype and all its
	implementations.  Therefore bump the minor version.

	* Release version 0.5

2015-08-14  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Fix segmentation fault when using Intel Hex files, caused by an
	error in libcintelhex.  A newer pre-release of libcintelhex is now
	referenced for the submodule.

	* Release version 0.4.2

	* Fix README.md syntax compatibility for GitHub and include it in
	the distribution.
	* Fix bugs related to the handling of text / binary file modes on
	Windows.
	* Update included libcintelhex reference to benefit from bug fixes
	there, some also related to binary file handling on Windows.

	newline).
	* Add a TODO list with ideas for future development.
	* Install documentation files: README, TODO, LICENSE, ChangeLog

	* Release version 0.4.1

2015-04-09  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Rework the build system, fixing several usage and portability
	problems.  Integrate GNU libtool for building libraries.
	* Fix a problem with iterating through symbol lists caused by an
	uninitialized local variable.
	* Rename the option --byte-size to --field-size and add another
	option --section-size.
	* Fix offset output for the --strings option to point at the
	length prefix byte.
	* Abuse the --symbols option to generate more machine-readable
	(non-localized) output for --strings and --section-size.
	* Adjust help output to exclude unavailable options and reflect
	the actually used default values.
	* Fix error handling when an expected ELF section could not be
	found.
	* Handle unprintable characters in custom_known_fields.c example.
	* Validate argument in custom_options.c example for --set-serial.
	* Revised README document for new features and minor corrections.

	* Release version 0.4.

2014-08-08  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Clean up build system for more stability and better user
	interaction.
	* Fix some portability problems to enable building on MinGW.
	* Switch default output image format to Intel Hex, as the help
	string already stated.
	* Fix help output to list --strings option in the right group.
	* Include German translation.
	* Include a README document with detailed setup and usage
	instructions.

	* Release version 0.3.

	* Add support for GNU Gettext and Gnulib packages.  To use Gnulib,
	it must be installed on the packager's machine, who runs
	`gnulib-tool --update` in the top-level package directory.  The
	resulting distribution archive will include all necessary gnulib
	checks to work around problematic user platforms during
	compilation.

	* Release version 0.2.

2014-05-28  André Colomb  <src@andre.colomb.de>

	* Release version 0.1.
